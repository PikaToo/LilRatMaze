## Lil' Rat Maze ##
This is a short horror game about navigating a 3D maze while outmaneuvering the local giant rat population. This game is a project that was created to serve as a tangible product using the Unity game engine. The game is available at https://pika2.itch.io/lil-rat-maze.

## Lore ###
You wake up on a damp floor with no recollection of any recent events except for your extremely strong desire to eat a large amount of cheese. On your person you find a flashlight and nothing else. At the very least, your only light source seems to work. You have no choice but to look around for either a way out, or some cheese.

## How to Play ###
### 1. Download the zip file
Go to https://pika2.itch.io/lil-rat-maze, scroll down, then click Download.

### 2. Extract the zip file
Using any software of your choice, extract the zip file. If you don't have a software to extract zip files and your operating system doesn't come built-in with it, I recommend 7-zip.

### 3. Run the exe
Run the file titled `Lil' Rat Maze.exe`.

## Controls ###
These are shown in-game, but include:

- Move with WASD. 
- Toggle flashlight with F. 
- Sprint with Shift.
- Jump with Space.
- Exit with Escape.
    
Note you are never _expected_ to jump, but it can be comforting to know you are able to.
